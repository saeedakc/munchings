Proposal:
Hypothesis: There is a correlation between the consumption of healthy foods and the income level of households across the United States. 

We will determine this correlation by analyzing the relationship between consumption, food type, and income levels. We will generate an interactive map that allows the user to select various objects such as different food types and income levels and in return, will display the consumption. We will showcase a map that displays the distance between low-income households and their accessibility to grocery stores within a given area. In addition, by measuring household income by commodity consumption we can gather a sound conclusion to either reject or accept our hypothesis.

# Possible D3.js libraries:

https://observablehq.com/@d3/diverging-stacked-bar-chart Diverging Stacked Bar Charts to show relationships between food groups.

https://observablehq.com/@d3/radial-stacked-bar-chart Radial Bar Chart to show specific food type consumption (versus some static category, like income?)

https://observablehq.com/@d3/bivariate-choropleth Bivariate Chloropleth to show relationship between two conditions (income on one axis and obesity? Nutrition? On the other)
